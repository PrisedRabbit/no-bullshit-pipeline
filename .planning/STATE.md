## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-roadmap]: Tags replaced by pipelines — zero-step pipeline = label; migration is lazy (per-recording on access, not batch)
- [Pre-roadmap]: Notion auth via API key only (no OAuth) — internal integration token is sufficient for single-user desktop app
- [Pre-roadmap]: Prompt augmentation uses hard `Result<>` return — no silent fallthrough to non-JSON LLM output
- [Pre-roadmap]: Pin Notion API version to `2022-06-28` — 2025-09-03 introduced breaking multi-source DB change irrelevant to NBP
- [Pre-roadmap]: SortableJS loaded as local vendor file — native HTML5 DnD is unreliable in macOS WKWebView
- [Pre-roadmap]: Integration profiles stored as separate JSON files in `~/.nbp/config/integrations/` — never inside `settings.json`
- [Pre-roadmap]: Pipeline builder uses state-first full re-render pattern before any drag-and-drop code — prevents DOM/state desync

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: `notion-client 1.0.11` method signatures not fully verified — run `cargo doc` after adding dependency to confirm exact API surface before writing integration module
- [Phase 3]: Prompt augmentation token budget estimate ("< 500 tokens") needs validation against real Notion databases with 10-20 properties before field relevance filter is deprioritized
- [Phase 7]: Exact shape of existing `metadata.json` files with `tags` field should be audited against real data before writing migration code
